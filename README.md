## Description: Web-based app built with Python (Flask), Jinja Templates, JavaScript and Bootstrap.

This web application was made as a [final project](https://cs50.harvard.edu/python/2022/project/) for [Harvard's Introduction to Programming](https://www.edx.org/course/cs50s-introduction-to-programming-with-python) course. The goal was to build a full fledged web application, combining the knowledge obtained from both [CS50](https://www.edx.org/course/introduction-computer-science-harvardx-cs50x) and [CS50P](https://www.edx.org/course/cs50s-introduction-to-programming-with-python) courses.

CV-Generator helps users to create a portable document format (pdf) of a CV (*Curriculum Vitae*) after filling out a single page form.

## Features
- **Personal Information** section where users type their name, address, upload their picture, etc.
- **Target Job Title** section
- **Experience** section where users enter up to five vocational experiences.
- **Education** section allows user to add up to five different educational fields on their CV.
- **Skills** section where users type their skills which make them stand out in the job market.
- **Functions** for formatting data which were also included in unit test:
  - `get_duration()` is a function which takes two dates as arguments and calculates the duration between two dates and returns that duration in years and months.
  - `date_formatter()` is a function which takes a date as an argument in 'YYYY-MM' format and returns a string type of the date in 'MM.YYYY' format.
  - `skill_formatter()` is a function which takes an array of strings of skills as an argument and returns just a single string with pipe '|' added between each skills.
